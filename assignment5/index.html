I'm sure you didn't really wanna get into what we started talkin about and maybe I'm reading too much into it especially with your kinda of cold good nite. "u too"? Its just we opened a can of worms that I know ur not exactly thrilled about, esp once u started talking about me with other girls. 




If I act differently in different situations its bc people make snap judgements and I want to be on everyone's good side. I don't want to step on toes unless I have to. For guys I can be more blunt and it doesn't bother me, but for girls in general I guess I try to be more delicate. 

I don't think of other girls the way I think of u. It hurts me that you think I'm flirty. I never thought of myself that way and I don't want to put doubt in your head that I'm not in this for the real thing.



**In some part of my head I think I should treat guys and girls differently. Girls that deserve it, should be treated 

And yes, we're both unsure of how things are gonna end up, whether we just stay as friends or go the distance but you are special to me no matter what. When I said those things about u the other day, and u said u were speechless, i hope u know that I really do mean EVERYTHING i said. I don't have to put up a front or anything with you bc it all feels so natural and in so many ways it feels right to be with u. Any extra effort I put in doesn't have to forced. I WANT to do it for you and me. 

You've made me feel differently
